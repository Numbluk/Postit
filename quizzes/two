What is REST and how does it relate to the resources routes?

REST refers to REpresentational State Transfer. It uses a statless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol. RESTful apps use HTTP requests to implement CRUD operations. When we use resources routes, we are mapping browser requests to the controller actions of our apps.



What's the major difference between model backed and non-model backed form helpers?

On model backed helpers the form is tied to a model and Rails will auto fill-in forms on model backed ones and knows if it will be a POST or a PATCH. We usually use model-backed helpers for CRUD operations.



How does form_for know how to build the <form> element?

You pass it an instance of the model.



What's the general pattern we use in the actions that handle submission of model-backed forms (ie, the create and update actions)?

if @model.save?
  notify
  redirect_elsewhere
else
  render something_showing_error
end



How exactly do Rails validations get triggered? Where are the errors saved? How do we show the validation messages on the user interface?

What are Rails partials?

Rails partials are a way to reuse similar code (and thus share HTML).
